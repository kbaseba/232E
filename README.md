# ECE 232E: Large Scale Social and Complex Networks (Spring 2025)

Official repository for all code developed as part of **ECE 232E - Large Scale Social and Complex Networks**, taught by **Prof. Vwani Roychowdhury** at UCLA in Spring 2025.

This course explores mathematical foundations and algorithmic tools used to analyze real-world networks at scale‚Äîsuch as social, information, and biological networks. Topics include random graph models, community detection, ranking algorithms, and reinforcement learning on graphs.

This repository contains all code and documentation related to the **four main projects**, each located in its own folder.
